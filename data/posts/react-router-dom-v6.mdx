Most of the application you develop will have multiple pages and you would require to have a separate URL for each one of them.
React cannot handle routing on its own. There are many libraries like **[react router](https://reactrouter.com/)**, **[react navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/web-support/)** etc to handle navigation in react. In this post we will see how we can use react router to handle navigation in react apps.


## Project setup


Install the react-router-dom package:

```md 
$ npm install react-router-dom@6
```
```md
$ yarn add react-router-dom@6
```
```md 
$ pnpm add react-router-dom@6
```


## Basic Routing


Now in ***index.js*** wrap the App component with the BrowserRouter component, which can be imported from the ***react-router-dom*** package that we just installed.


```js
import React from "react"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom"
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom"
import App from "./App"
import "./index.css"

    ReactDOM.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <BrowserRouter>
            <App />
        </BrowserRouter>
    </React.StrictMode>,
    document.getElementById("root")
    )
```


It is necessary to wrap any routes or links created using react router with ***Router*** component (in our case ***BrowserRouter***). So we wrap the whole application inside ***BrowserRouter***.


## Now update ***App.js*** with the following code:


```js
import React from "react"
import { Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom"
import Home from './components/Home'
import About from './components/About'
import NotFound from './components/NotFound'

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<Home />}></Route>
          <Route path="about" element={<About />}></Route>
          <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />}></Route>
        </Routes>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```


* The component that needs to be rendered when the user is navigated to a particular path is defined by the ***element*** property in the Route component. For example, ***/about*** route will render the ***About*** component.
* If you want to display a 404 page when the path does not match with any of the routes then you can define a route with path as *.
* Finally, we need to wrap all the ***Route*** components inside the ***Routes*** component, which is again exported from ***react-router-dom***.
* The order of ***Route*** components does not matter. React router will match the best route irrespective of order.
